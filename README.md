Hotel Management System

The objective of this project is to simplify the hotel operations by automating the major aspects of hotel management which include checking the availability of rooms, room amenities, 
check-in, check-out, ordering food, and viewing all the booking record.
I have ceated a SQL Server database to retrive data like room details(rooms) and food menu(menu), and also to store data like booking details(bookings) and food ordered(food_orders).

The tables created and their relationship is as shown below-
